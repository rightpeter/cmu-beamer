The package provides a beamer theme for Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).  It
includes a basic template demonstrating the use of this theme.  Place all the
files in your presentation directory, edit the template.tex file, and run e.g.
'pdflatex template.tex' twice (to properly generate outline/navigation
information).

About this theme:
